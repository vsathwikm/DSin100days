    "Before we begin we would like to understand a few terms -\n",
    "1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The Gross Domestic Product is the total value (in dollars or any other currency) of goods produced and services provided within a country.\n",
    "2. GDP Per Capita: The GDP per capita is the value derived when the GDP of the country is divided by its population. The number signifies the approximate amount of money (in dollars or other currency) in terms of products or services that is available for each individual within the country.\n",
    "3. Child Mortality Rate (MR): Mortality Rate is given here by the percentage of deaths of child under the age of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child Mortality Rate and Life Expectancy are two of the measures which convey the quality, availability and affordability of food, water, healthcare etc., within a country. When these metrics are combined with the GDP per capita of a country, we can understand whether the economic condition of the country is supportive of basic survival. \n",

    "We will now try to analyze the data collected, by building visualizations using 'pyvizwizards' library. The pyvizwizards library is created by the Refactored team and has functions which can be used to load, select and visualize the above datasets. It is based on Plotly and Plotly Express - an interactive plotting library that helps visualize multi-dimensional data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just click on any code cell and press <b><h3>\"Control+Enter\"</h3></b> <br>keys (+ means press together) to execute the code in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel status\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run a code, sometimes it may take a long time to run. In such a situation, we are to be patient and check the status of the kernel, before running the next piece of code. The circle to the top right corner of this notebook shows whether the kernel is running and busy, or is idle and ready to execute some code.\n",
