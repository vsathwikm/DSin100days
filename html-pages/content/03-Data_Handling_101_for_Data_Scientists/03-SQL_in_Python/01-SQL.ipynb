    "# SQL in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in earlier lessons, Python is very flexible and has a wide range of libraries and third-party modules to support many operations. SQL (Structured Query Language) can be executed from within Python using sqlite3. The sqlite3 module offers support to connect to an external database and execute SQL queries. However, this module does not offer the complete querying capability of a typical SQL engine and functions as a light-weight API version of the querying engine. Other modules like MySQLdb (same as mysql-python), offer a more extensive range of functions and query processing abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be discussing sqlite3 module, as it is the widely used. Though it is a light-weight module, it supports almost all basic sql operations and can be implemented for a database of up to 140 Terabytes in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sqlite db engine is also available for installation as a standalone application. The installation packages are available at Sqlite's official downloads page - https://www.sqlite.org/download.html. Once downloaded and installed, the application/db engine can be launched by running the 'sqlite3' application file through terminal. While starting the engine we can also simultaneously create and open a new database. This is saved as a '.db' file in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How to create a sqlite3 database(db) file? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installation of sqlite engine is complete, the steps to create a new db are fairly simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch command prompt or any other terminal window\n",
    "2. Navigate to the folder where the sqlite installation is done\n",
    "3. Execute the command 'sqlite3 <path/new_db_name.db>' and type '.databases' command to verify the creation of the database\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1. Launch command prompt or any other terminal window<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/launch-cmd.png\" style=\"width:20vw\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Step 2: Navigate to the folder where the sqlite installation is done<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/sqlite-path.PNG\" style=\"width:60vw\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Step 3: Execute the command sqlite3 <path/new_db_name.db><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/create-sqlitedb.PNG\" style=\"width:60vw\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Result:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/created-sqlitedb.PNG\" style=\"width:45vw\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Note: The 'db' file is created in the same folder where 'sqlite3' application file exists, as no path was mentioned in the above command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connect() Method - Connecting to the Database \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in executing SQL through Python is connecting to an external database file. The 'connect' method in the sqlite module helps to create a connection with an external database. The method accepts the name of the external database as argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> When a database name is passed as an argument to the 'connect' method, a connection is established with the external database. However, if no such database exists, sqlite creates a new database with the same name and connect method establishes a connection with the newly created database, bearing the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create a database in-memory by passing \":memory:\" as the argument, however care needs to be taken as this consumes RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection is stored as a connection object. Methods like cursor, commit, close, rollback, execute, create_function, etc., can be called on the connection object. In order to learn the full-range of methods and their descriptions, please refer to the sqlite module documentation (Link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Data History</u>: As part of this exercise, we will work with the 'Murders' data. This dataset consists of the number of murders committed in the given metropolitan city. The data for two years, 2014 and 2015 is given, along with a column which shows the change in number of murders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the connect method to establish a connection with a database file created within memory (Hint: Use :memory: to create an in-memory database)."
