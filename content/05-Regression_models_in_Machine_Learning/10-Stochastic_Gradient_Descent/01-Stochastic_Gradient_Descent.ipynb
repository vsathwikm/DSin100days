Take for example in case gradient descent when it comes to linear regression. We are trying to find the best values of the slope and the intercept of line that best fits the data. \n",

    "2) Find the error using $\\hat y$ and $y$  where y is the target in our supervised dataset<br> \n",
    "3) Calculate the cost function using the error <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now when we do this procedure from step 1) to 4) for small datasets this works really well. We can minimize our parameters  over the whole dataset. But when we start to get into large datasets, the kind of datasets in reality, this whole approach breaks down. In such situations we can modify the gradient descent procedure such that, rather than minimizing the cost function over the whole dataset and then updating our parameters, we minimize a single data point and update the parameter.\n",

    "You can see we have a nicely spread out distribution with a peak at around 67% accuracy. This distribution will change if you run it again. All of this is happening due to the small change that we made in how we update our weights i.e the effect of using equation 3 rather than equation 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "This constant change in the accuracy is because we are updating equation the weights constantly. If we were to plot the value of the cost function each time we updated the weights we will find that there will be a lot of variation in the cost over the number of iteration. It will come down to a single value but after a lot of variation. This is where stochastic gradient descent gets its name from. This variation in the cost function is stochastic hence the name. \n",

The axis of both plots for above and below are the same. What you can see is that although the most probable accuracy is still around 67% we have access higher accuracy models in when we change the hyper parameters like learning rate, regularization etc. While you can change many parameters when doing gradient descent, you general have more control over how you are minimizing the cost function when you use stochastic gradient descent. \n"

    "This control of minimization matters a lot when you are dealing with large datasets which can only be fit using complex models like neural networks. In case of neural networks, you have millions of parameters, hence optimization can be really hard. With such large datasets you cannot use gradient descent since you cannot minimize all your data at once. In such situation, you use either stochastic gradient descent or a variation of it called batch gradient descent where you minimize small number of data points, then update the parameter then repeat it until you go over the whole dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "One place where stochastic gradient descent is especially useful when we are working non-neural network models is when we have memory constrains. Suppose you have a dataset that is 5GB and you have only 4GB of RAM, you can use SGDClassifier or Regressor to fit models since it will not load the whole dataset to the memory, the way you would normal do with gradient descent based optimization. That is why SGD provides different types of loss options for different models. For example- we used \"log\" loss which means that the SGDClassifier is using a logistic regression model that is being optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We can build a support vector machine using \"hinge\" loss in the SGDClassifier. There are other options as well so check out the documentation for SDGClassifier and Regressor to get a better idea of what algorithms can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the full applicability of stochastic gradient descent we need to see training examples using neural networks which is out of the scope of this section. Despite this you can see that sgd does give you access to better optimized model. As we close this notebook, we should remember that its not just the accuracy that you get with a model that is important, its also how you got it that matters as well. \n",
