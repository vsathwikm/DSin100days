    "<b>Tasks:</b>\n",
    "1. Create an empty database named 'moviesdb' using connect method.\n",
    "2. Create empty tables with connected relationships among the three tables as shown in above diagram. Using foreign key constraints and enforce referential integrity.\n",
    "3. Extract the data from the three tables, links of which are provided in the code block. Load them into a dataframe and then into the table.\n",
    "4. Write a query to extract data of which movie ran at over 80% of seating capacity and at which hall this was achieved. The query should extract all combinations of movie and hall with over 80% capacity."
