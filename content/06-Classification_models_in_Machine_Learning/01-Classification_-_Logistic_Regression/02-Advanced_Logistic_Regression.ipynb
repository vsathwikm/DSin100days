    "## Optimization Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Linear regression section of this course, that one of the main tasks of the algorithm is to find the loss function and find the co-efficients to minimize the loss. This is done by optimization function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Logistic regression using sklearn, these are called solvers and some of the optimization algorithms used are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton Conjugate Gradient \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton-cg mthod is a constrained optimization using Hessian Matrix to find the minima, maxima, or saddle points. Newton's method is applied to the derivative f′ of a twice-differentiable function f to find the roots of the derivative, also known as the stationary points of f. One of these will be the optima. The Newton's method converges much faster towards a local maximum or minimum than gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s computationally expensive algorithm and hence not suitable for large feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Algorithm (L-BFGS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BFGS method belongs to quasi-Newton methods, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seek a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function. For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero. Newton's method and the BFGS methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum. However, BFGS can have acceptable performance even for non-smooth optimization instances. The Hessian matrix of second derivatives is not computed. Instead, the Hessian matrix is approximated using updates specified by gradient evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the BFGS(Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Algorithm), L-BFGS uses an estimation to the inverse Hessian matrix to steer its search through variable space, but where BFGS stores a dense  n*n approximation to the inverse Hessian (n being the number of variables in the problem), L-BFGS stores only a few vectors that represent the approximation implicitly. Due to its resulting linear memory requirement, the L-BFGS method is particularly well suited for optimization problems with a large number of variables. Instead of the inverse Hessian Hk, L-BFGS maintains a history of the past m updates of the position x and gradient ∇f(x), where generally the history size m can be small (m<10). These updates are used to implicitly do operations requiring the Hk-vector product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses less memory, and hence when dataset is small (small number of samples), L-BFGS relatively performs better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liblinear - Library for Large Linear Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a linear classification that supports logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver uses a coordinate descent (CD) algorithm that solves optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIBLINEAR provides Automatic parameter selection - L1 Regularization and it’s recommended when you have high dimension dataset - with lot os features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It cannot learn a true multinomial (multiclass) model; instead, the optimization problem is decomposed in a “one-vs-rest” fashion so separate binary classifiers are trained for all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAG - Stochastic Average Gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "SAG method optimizes the sum of a finite number of smooth convex functions. Like stochastic gradient (SG) methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, the number of samples and the number of features are large, SAG performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAGA:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAGA solver is a variant of SAG that also supports the non-smooth penalty=l1 option (i.e. L1 Regularization). This is therefore the solver of choice for sparse multinomial logistic regression and it’s also suitable very Large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like SAG, for large datasets SAGA is preferred.\n",
